# NHLShiftStats1
This program will allow user to analyze NHL lines combinations, thus uncovering one of great misteries of the game to a user. First, a user will select date. Then menu with all games played on this date will open. User will select one game at a time. That will run a function which determines forward lines and defensive pairs, and probability of them to play together during the game. Also, a very important part is to determine which line played against which line. And that will be done by periods.

## Special Teams
Attempt will be made to determine PP and PK units. Don't know how yet especially for cases like 4x4 or 5x3. 

## Player did not finish game
In some games, players get injured. Or some players get game misconduct penalty. They cannot finish game. That results in defensive pair of lines of forwards change as game goes by. If a skater did not have a shift during last 10 minutes of the game, a message will appear that he did not finish the game, without specific reason. 

## Print Goals Button
This is optional feature will print all goals of the game to the screen if a user wants to see that. But this button is unlikely to stay there in the final version.
